Just wanted to test out my knowledge of linear algebra. So made this, using pure math and pure magic of Rust. All my knowledge comes from 3B1B's amazing playlist on [linear algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=I-cRWnJgXXZ8c-Qb). I used no other resource while building it and have only terminological knowledge of the domain of computer graphics outside it. 

NOTE: The version of `turtle` used in this project is a fork of the original one - which is now inactive without any contributions. Its latest published revision (1.0.0-rc.3) has outdated dependencies leading to a critical bug (program crashes during any mouse event). The fork contains updated dependencies which solve this issue.
